         <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'> "\n\n2. SCREEN AND BUTTONS"</font></b>

        "\n\nThis application consists of 4 different screens."
        "\n\nThese are the main screen, the file management screen, the help screen, and the about screen."

        <b>"\n\nThe Main Screen"</b>

        "\n\nAt the top of the main screen is a description of the service status and the selected file. There are two buttons under these explanation texts."
        "\n\nThe button on the left is the button that starts and stops the HCE service. If no file is selected, this button is grayed out."
        "\n\nThe button on the right is the file management button. Using this button, you can import files and any of the imported files can be selected to be used in the HCE service."

        <b>"\n\nThe File Management Screen"</b>

        "\n\nThere are two main headings on the file management screen. These are: File Selection, Add new file."
        "\n\nThere are two different buttons under the Add new file heading. These are: Browse and Import."
        "\n\nThe Browse button starts an activity to select a file and the user can select a file with txt extension from any different path (Please see the 5th heading to find out what features the selected file should have)."
        "\n\nImport button imports the file selected by the user into the application files. If there is no file selected, this button is grayed out."

        <b>"\n\nThe Help Screen"</b>

        "\n\nIt is the screen consisting of written information to inform the user about the application. You are on this screen right now."

        <b>"\n\nThe About Screen"</b>

        "\n\nThis is the screen that gives information about the developer and source code of the application."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n3. HOW DOES THE APPLICATION WORK ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nThe application expects the user to import a txt file in the appropriate format for apdu communication (see the titles 4, 5 and 6 for details)."
        "\n\nAll imported txt files can be seen in the spinner under the "File Selection" title under the "Manage File" screen."
        "\n\nThe user should select the desired txt file with the spinner and press the "Use Selected File" button. Thus the selected file will be used by the HCE service."
        "\n\nAfter selecting the file, return to the main screen and click the "Start Service" button. The application now emulates the card specified with the txt file."
        "\n\nWhen you bring your device closer to the target terminal (This distance should be maximum 4 cm.) The communication between the terminal and the card will appear on the main screen under "Communication Logs"."

         <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'> "\n\n4. HOW TO IMPORT FILE(s) ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nThere is a "Manage File" button on the main screen of the application. This button navigates to the user file management screen."
        "\n\nOn this screen, there are "Browse" and "Import" buttons under the "Add New File" heading."
        "\n\nIn the first stage, the "Import" button is inactive and appears in gray. The user must first press the "Browse" button to select a file."
        "\n\nAfter the file selection is complete, the "Import" button becomes active and turns blue. If the "Import" button is clicked, the file will be imported."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n5. WHAT FORMAT SHOULD THE IMPORTED FILE BE ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nBy default, the application only allows txt format to be browsed. Thus, all the imported files will be in txt format."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n6. WHAT SHOULD THE CONTENT OF THE IMPORTED FILE BE ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nThe files must contain an equal number of command APDUs and response APDUs."
        "\n\nCommand APDU should be in the first line and response APDU should be in the other line. Thus, the Application can know which response will be given for which command."
        "\n\nC-APDU keywords are used for command APDU and "R-APDU" keywords are used for response APDU."
        <b>"\n\nPlease review the example below."</b>

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n7. HOW TO EMULATE THE CARD WITH THE IMPORTED FILE ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nOn the Manage File screen, there is the title "File Selection". Under this heading, there is a spinner for imported files."
        "\n\nThe user selects the desired file with the spinner and presses the "Use Selected File" button. Thus, the file is made available for"
        "use by the HCE service. Whenever the user presses the "Start Service" button on the main screen, the service will run with the selected file."

        <b>"\n\nNOTE:"</b>
        "A new file can be selected while the service is active."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n8. HOW TO START THE HOST BASED CARD EMULATION SERVICE ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nFor this process, there is a special button called "Start Service" on the main screen. This button is initially grayed out"
        "because no file has been selected yet. After selecting File, this button becomes active and turns blue."
        "\n\nThe service becomes active when the user presses the button."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n9. HOW TO STOP THE HOST BASED CARD EMULATION SERVICE ?"</font></b>

        "\n\nBy default, the service is not started. That's why the "Start Service" button appears on the main screen. If the user has started"
        "the service, the same button will appear in a different form as "Stop Service". It is enough to press this button to stop the service."
        "\n\nIn other words, the same button is used to start the service when the service is stopped and to stop the service when it is started."

          <b><font fgcolor='#0070F5'>"\n\n10. SENDING LOGS BY EMAIL"</font></b>

        "\n\nThe application follows the steps of the user, important events and records them as log messages."

        "\n\nThese log messages can be shared with the circular email button located in the lower right corner of the application"
        "and visible on each different screen."
        "After sharing, the user can preferably clear the log messages with the pop-up dialog box."
